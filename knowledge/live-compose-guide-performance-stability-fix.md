      A possible path to resolving stability issues for small classes with inexpensive .equals() checks is to annotate unstable classes with either @Stable or @Immutable.

      Annotating a class is overriding what the compiler would otherwise infer about your class. It is similar to the !! operator in Kotlin. You should be very careful about how you use these annotations. Overriding the compiler behavior could lead you to unforeseen bugs, such as your composable not recomposing when you expect it to.

      With Strong skipping mode enabled, follow these guidelines when deciding whether to add @Stable or @Immutable:

      Don't annotate classes that are already inferred as stable: Classes with val properties of stable types in modules built with the Compose compiler are already inferred as stable.

      Only annotate classes with cheap .equals() checks when instances are recreated: Add @Stable or @Immutable when the compiler can't infer stability (for example, interfaces or classes from non-Compose modules) and a data source allocates new object instances for unchanged items on every emission, provided the class is small and has an inexpensive .equals() check.

      Be cautious with models containing collections: Avoid adding @Stable or @Immutable to data models that hold large collections (List, Set, Map), especially for models used in lazy layouts (LazyColumn, LazyRow, LazyGrid, Pager). Leaving those models unannotated lets Compose compare them using instance equality (===) instead of running structural .equals() checks across every element.

      The following snippet provides a minimal example of a flat data class (without collection properties) annotated as immutable when defined in a module where the compiler cannot infer stability:

      @Immutable
      data class SnackSummary(
          val id: Long,
          val name: String,
          val price: Long
      )

      Whether you use the @Immutable or @Stable annotation, the Compose compiler marks the SnackSummary class as stable and compares it using Object.equals().

      Consider a composable that includes a parameter of type List<Snack>:

      Even if Snack is stable or annotated with @Immutable, the Compose compiler still marks the snacks parameter in HighlightedSnacks as unstable because List is an interface.

      With Strong skipping mode enabled, HighlightedSnacks is still marked skippable and skips recomposition using instance equality (===) when the same List instance is passed. You can make the snacks parameter stable by wrapping List<Snack> in an @Immutable wrapper class, replacing List<Snack> with ImmutableList<Snack>, or adding kotlin.collections.* to your stability configuration file.

      However, doing so causes Compose to run an element-by-element .equals() comparison on every recomposition pass. Only use these approaches when you can't preserve the list's instance reference and benchmarks show a benefit.

    excerpt: |-
      A common reason why Compose considers a class unstable is collections. As noted in the Diagnose stability issues page, the Compose compiler cannot be completely sure that collection interfaces such as List, Map, and Set are truly immutable and therefore marks them as unstable.

      Consider this class from the Diagnose stability issues guide:

      unstable class Snack {
        …
        unstable val tags: Set<String>
        …
      }

      With Strong skipping mode enabled (the default in Kotlin 2.0.20 and higher), unstable collections and classes containing collections already skip recomposition using instance equality (===) whenever the same reference is passed.

      Be cautious before replacing kotlin.collections.List, Set, or Map with Kotlinx Immutable Collections (ImmutableList, ImmutableSet, ImmutableMap), or adding @Immutable, @Stable, or stability_config.conf rules to collection-holding models. Under strong skipping mode, standard List skips using reference equality (===), whereas ImmutableList and annotated collection models run element-by-element .equals() comparisons on every recomposition pass.

      For large collections or lazy layouts (LazyColumn, LazyRow, LazyGrid), checking .equals() on every item can take longer than recomposing. This cost doubles if you pass an ImmutableList property from a data class to a child composable:

      data class SnackCategory(
          val name: String,
          val snacks: ImmutableList<Snack>
      )

      @Composable
      fun CategorySection(category: SnackCategory) {
          Text(category.name)
          // Compose compares category.snacks twice: once in SnackCategory.equals()
          // for CategorySection, and again for HighlightedSnacks.
          HighlightedSnacks(snacks = category.snacks)
      }

      Instead of forcing structural equality on collections, preserve the collection's instance reference across emissions (for example, by caching transformations in your ViewModel or with remember) so Compose can skip using instance equality (===). Consider ImmutableList or stability annotations on collection-holding models only when you can't preserve the collection's instance reference and benchmarks confirm that structural equality checks are faster than recomposing.

    excerpt: |-
      You can also make an unstable class completely immutable so the compiler can infer its stability automatically.

      Immutable: Indicates a type where the value of any properties can never change after an instance of that type is constructed, and all methods are referentially transparent. Make sure all the class's properties are both val rather than var, and of immutable types. Primitive types such as String, Int, and Float are always immutable. Flat data class types with val primitive or String properties in modules built with the Compose compiler are already inferred as stable and compared with .equals() automatically—you don't need to annotate them with @Immutable. If immutability is impossible, then you must use Compose state for any mutable properties.

      Stable: Indicates a type that is mutable. The Compose runtime does not become aware if and when any of the type's public properties or method behavior would yield different results from a previous invocation.

      To solve this issue you can take one of the following approaches:

      Add small, flat classes with cheap .equals() checks to your Compiler configuration file.

      Enable the Compose compiler on your data layer modules, or tag your classes with @Stable or @Immutable where appropriate. This involves adding a Compose dependency to your data layer. However, it is just the dependency for the Compose runtime and not for Compose-UI.

      Within your UI module, wrap your data layer classes in UI-specific wrapper classes.

      The same issue also occurs when using external libraries if they don't use the Compose compiler.

    excerpt: |-
      Another common issue involves multi-module architecture. The Compose compiler can only infer whether a class is stable if all of the non-primitive types that it references are either explicitly marked as stable or in a module that was also built with the Compose compiler.

      If your data layer is in a separate module to your UI layer, which is the recommended approach, this may be an issue you encounter. Under Strong skipping mode, classes from non-Compose modules are treated as unstable and still skip recomposition using instance equality (===) when the same instance is passed. However, if your data layer frequently allocates new instances of small, flat models with identical values on every emission, you can opt in to structural equality (Object.equals()).

    excerpt: |-
      When working to fix issues with stability, you shouldn't attempt to make every composable skippable or force structural equality on every parameter. Skipping a composable isn't free: every parameter of a skippable composable is stored by the Compose runtime as if it was remembered, and Compose must compare each parameter against its previous value each time the function recomposes to determine whether it should be skipped. Attempting to force skipping everywhere can lead to premature optimization that introduces more overhead than it saves.

      There are many situations where forcing structural stability doesn't have any real benefit and can degrade performance or maintainability. For example:

      A composable that is not recomposed often, or at all.

      A composable that in itself just calls skippable composables.

      A composable with a large number of parameters or collection models with expensive .equals() implementations. In this case, the cost of checking if any parameter has changed can outweigh the cost of a cheap recomposition.

      Don't over-index on recomposition counts alone. Focus on making composables lightweight to execute, deferring rapidly changing state reads to the Layout or Draw phases, and verifying changes with benchmarks. When a composable is skippable, it adds a small overhead which may not be worth it. You can even annotate your composable to be non-restartable or non-skippable in cases where you determine that being restartable or skippable is more overhead than it's worth.

# Fix stability issues

## Annotate with Stable or Immutable

A possible path to resolving stability issues for small classes with inexpensive .equals() checks is to annotate unstable classes with either @Stable or @Immutable.

Annotating a class is overriding what the compiler would otherwise infer about your class. It is similar to the !! operator in Kotlin. You should be very careful about how you use these annotations. Overriding the compiler behavior could lead you to unforeseen bugs, such as your composable not recomposing when you expect it to.

With Strong skipping mode enabled, follow these guidelines when deciding whether to add @Stable or @Immutable:

Don't annotate classes that are already inferred as stable: Classes with val properties of stable types in modules built with the Compose compiler are already inferred as stable.

Only annotate classes with cheap .equals() checks when instances are recreated: Add @Stable or @Immutable when the compiler can't infer stability (for example, interfaces or classes from non-Compose modules) and a data source allocates new object instances for unchanged items on every emission, provided the class is small and has an inexpensive .equals() check.

Be cautious with models containing collections: Avoid adding @Stable or @Immutable to data models that hold large collections (List, Set, Map), especially for models used in lazy layouts (LazyColumn, LazyRow, LazyGrid, Pager). Leaving those models unannotated lets Compose compare them using instance equality (===) instead of running structural .equals() checks across every element.

The following snippet provides a minimal example of a flat data class (without collection properties) annotated as immutable when defined in a module where the compiler cannot infer stability:

@Immutable
data class SnackSummary(
    val id: Long,
    val name: String,
    val price: Long
)

Whether you use the @Immutable or @Stable annotation, the Compose compiler marks the SnackSummary class as stable and compares it using Object.equals().

Sources: [live-compose-guide-performance-stability-fix-annotate-stable-source](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/performance/stability/fix#annotate-stable)

## Annotated classes in collections

Consider a composable that includes a parameter of type List<Snack>:

restartable skippable scheme("[androidx.compose.ui.UiComposable]") fun HighlightedSnacks(
  stable index: Int
  unstable snacks: List<Snack>
  stable onSnackClick: Function1<Long, Unit>
  stable modifier: Modifier? = @static Companion
)

Even if Snack is stable or annotated with @Immutable, the Compose compiler still marks the snacks parameter in HighlightedSnacks as unstable because List is an interface.

With Strong skipping mode enabled, HighlightedSnacks is still marked skippable and skips recomposition using instance equality (===) when the same List instance is passed. You can make the snacks parameter stable by wrapping List<Snack> in an @Immutable wrapper class, replacing List<Snack> with ImmutableList<Snack>, or adding kotlin.collections.* to your stability configuration file.

However, doing so causes Compose to run an element-by-element .equals() comparison on every recomposition pass. Only use these approaches when you can't preserve the list's instance reference and benchmarks show a benefit.

Sources: [live-compose-guide-performance-stability-fix-annotated-classes-source](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/performance/stability/fix#annotated-classes)

## Stability configuration file

Beginning with Compose Compiler 1.5.5, a configuration file of classes to consider stable can be provided at compile time. This allows for considering classes you don't control, such as standard library classes like LocalDateTime, as stable.

The configuration file is a plain text file with one class per row. Comments, single, and double wildcards are supported.

An example configuration:

// Consider LocalDateTime stable
java.time.LocalDateTime
// Consider my datalayer stable
com.datalayer.*
// Consider my datalayer and all submodules stable
com.datalayer.**

To enable this feature, pass the path of the configuration file to the composeCompiler options block of the Compose compiler Gradle plugin configuration.

composeCompiler {
  stabilityConfigurationFile = rootProject.layout.projectDirectory.file("stability_config.conf")
}

As the Compose compiler runs on each module in your project separately, you can provide different configurations to different modules if needed. Alternatively, have one configuration at the root level of your project and pass that path to each module.

## Enable strong skipping

Strong skipping mode is enabled by default starting in Kotlin 2.0.20. Strong skipping mode allows composables with unstable parameters to be skipped by comparing unstable parameters using instance equality (===), while stable parameters continue to be compared using structural equality (Object.equals()).

If you are using a Kotlin version lower than 2.0.20, enable strong skipping mode first. If strong skipping mode is already enabled and a composable is still recomposing unnecessarily, check whether new instances of unstable parameters are being allocated on every recomposition pass.

See Strong skipping for more information.

## Collections and stability

A common reason why Compose considers a class unstable is collections. As noted in the Diagnose stability issues page, the Compose compiler cannot be completely sure that collection interfaces such as List, Map, and Set are truly immutable and therefore marks them as unstable.

Consider this class from the Diagnose stability issues guide:

unstable class Snack {
  …
  unstable val tags: Set<String>
  …
}

With Strong skipping mode enabled (the default in Kotlin 2.0.20 and higher), unstable collections and classes containing collections already skip recomposition using instance equality (===) whenever the same reference is passed.

Be cautious before replacing kotlin.collections.List, Set, or Map with Kotlinx Immutable Collections (ImmutableList, ImmutableSet, ImmutableMap), or adding @Immutable, @Stable, or stability_config.conf rules to collection-holding models. Under strong skipping mode, standard List skips using reference equality (===), whereas ImmutableList and annotated collection models run element-by-element .equals() comparisons on every recomposition pass.

For large collections or lazy layouts (LazyColumn, LazyRow, LazyGrid), checking .equals() on every item can take longer than recomposing. This cost doubles if you pass an ImmutableList property from a data class to a child composable:

data class SnackCategory(
    val name: String,
    val snacks: ImmutableList<Snack>
)

@Composable
fun CategorySection(category: SnackCategory) {
    Text(category.name)
    // Compose compares category.snacks twice: once in SnackCategory.equals()
    // for CategorySection, and again for HighlightedSnacks.
    HighlightedSnacks(snacks = category.snacks)
}

Instead of forcing structural equality on collections, preserve the collection's instance reference across emissions (for example, by caching transformations in your ViewModel or with remember) so Compose can skip using instance equality (===). Consider ImmutableList or stability annotations on collection-holding models only when you can't preserve the collection's instance reference and benchmarks confirm that structural equality checks are faster than recomposing.

## Introduction

When faced with an unstable class that causes performance issues, you should optimize how Compose compares or instantiates it. This document outlines several techniques you can use to do so.

## Make the class immutable

You can also make an unstable class completely immutable so the compiler can infer its stability automatically.

Immutable: Indicates a type where the value of any properties can never change after an instance of that type is constructed, and all methods are referentially transparent. Make sure all the class's properties are both val rather than var, and of immutable types. Primitive types such as String, Int, and Float are always immutable. Flat data class types with val primitive or String properties in modules built with the Compose compiler are already inferred as stable and compared with .equals() automatically—you don't need to annotate them with @Immutable. If immutability is impossible, then you must use Compose state for any mutable properties.

Stable: Indicates a type that is mutable. The Compose runtime does not become aware if and when any of the type's public properties or method behavior would yield different results from a previous invocation.

## Solution

To solve this issue you can take one of the following approaches:

Add small, flat classes with cheap .equals() checks to your Compiler configuration file.

Enable the Compose compiler on your data layer modules, or tag your classes with @Stable or @Immutable where appropriate. This involves adding a Compose dependency to your data layer. However, it is just the dependency for the Compose runtime and not for Compose-UI.

Within your UI module, wrap your data layer classes in UI-specific wrapper classes.

The same issue also occurs when using external libraries if they don't use the Compose compiler.

## Multiple modules

Another common issue involves multi-module architecture. The Compose compiler can only infer whether a class is stable if all of the non-primitive types that it references are either explicitly marked as stable or in a module that was also built with the Compose compiler.

If your data layer is in a separate module to your UI layer, which is the recommended approach, this may be an issue you encounter. Under Strong skipping mode, classes from non-Compose modules are treated as unstable and still skip recomposition using instance equality (===) when the same instance is passed. However, if your data layer frequently allocates new instances of small, flat models with identical values on every emission, you can opt in to structural equality (Object.equals()).

## Not every composable should be skippable

When working to fix issues with stability, you shouldn't attempt to make every composable skippable or force structural equality on every parameter. Skipping a composable isn't free: every parameter of a skippable composable is stored by the Compose runtime as if it was remembered, and Compose must compare each parameter against its previous value each time the function recomposes to determine whether it should be skipped. Attempting to force skipping everywhere can lead to premature optimization that introduces more overhead than it saves.

There are many situations where forcing structural stability doesn't have any real benefit and can degrade performance or maintainability. For example:

A composable that is not recomposed often, or at all.

A composable that in itself just calls skippable composables.

A composable with a large number of parameters or collection models with expensive .equals() implementations. In this case, the cost of checking if any parameter has changed can outweigh the cost of a cheap recomposition.

Don't over-index on recomposition counts alone. Focus on making composables lightweight to execute, deferring rapidly changing state reads to the Layout or Draw phases, and verifying changes with benchmarks. When a composable is skippable, it adds a small overhead which may not be worth it. You can even annotate your composable to be non-restartable or non-skippable in cases where you determine that being restartable or skippable is more overhead than it's worth.
